* Create a Uniswap v4 Pool

A single trading pair (*ETH/USDC*), can exist as an infinite number of pools in v4. Uniswap v4 does **not** restrict fee tiers to 1%, 0.30%, or 0.05%. A trading pair exists as many pools, but one *pool* has one *hook contract*

In V4, pools are initialized and managed by a single contract: `PoolManager`

*Think of a `PoolKey` as the unique identifier for a pool, i.e. like a v3 pair's contract address*

Creating a Pool is determined by 5 primary arguments:

* Trading pair *currency0, currency1*
* Fee tier
* Tick spacing
* Hook
* Starting Price

```solidity
{{{PoolInitialize}}}
```

### Examples of Initializing a V4 Pool

*Hooks are not mandatory, you can create a pool without a hook*

```solidity
{{{Hookless}}}
```

*Some hooks may require initialization data, i.e. `block.timestamp`*

```solidity
{{{HookDataInit}}}
```
